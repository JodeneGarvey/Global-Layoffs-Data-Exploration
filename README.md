The goal of this analysis is to:

Identify industries and companies most impacted by layoffs.

Explore how funding, company stage, and geography influence layoff trends.

Analyze layoff patterns over time and calculate rolling totals for better trend visualization.

Rank top companies by layoffs per year to detect recurring patterns or market shifts.
